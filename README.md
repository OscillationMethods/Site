## Overview

This repository is the source repository for creating the
[Oscillation Methods](https://oscillationmethods.github.io)
website.

These materials serve as a hosted version of materials for the
[Oscillation Methods](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/oscillationmethods)
project.

This repository has the tools for building the website.
The built version of book is then posted to the
[website repository](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/oscillationmethods.github.io)
for hosting.
